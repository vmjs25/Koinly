## Koinly Introduction

Founded in 2018 by Robin Singh, Koinly has grown into one of the most trusted crypto tax platforms worldwide. The London-based company set out to solve a simple problem: crypto taxes are confusing as hell, and someone needed to make them easier.

Here's what Koinly does well:

**Massive Integration Support** - Over 800 exchanges, wallets, and blockchains. From the big names like Coinbase and Binance to niche DeFi protocols, chances are Koinly supports whatever you're using.

**Smart Transaction Handling** - Koinly doesn't just import your data blindly. It groups split orders, excludes spam transactions, and identifies duplicate entries. This means you're not paying for thousands of unnecessary transactions.

**Real Portfolio Tracking** - Beyond taxes, you get live portfolio monitoring with unrealized gains, performance metrics, and insights into your holdings. It's like having TradingView for your entire crypto portfolio.

**Tax Reports That Actually Work** - Whether you're filing in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, or 15+ other countries, Koinly generates compliant reports with the correct cost-basis methods (FIFO, LIFO, HIFO, etc.).

**DeFi and NFT Ready** - Liquidity pools, yield farming, NFT flips—Koinly handles the complex stuff that makes other tax software cry. It automatically imports NFT trades for EVM-based chains and tracks your DeFi positions.

The platform has earned a 4.6 out of 5 rating on Trustpilot from over 2,200 reviews. Users consistently praise its accuracy, ease of use, and responsive customer support.
